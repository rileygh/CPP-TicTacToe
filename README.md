# CPP-TicTacToe
### Yet another simple project for the sole purpose of my education in C++ ;D
#### Quite a basic idea, but this one really helped me build an understanding of the language.

### Usage
- Compile and run, it's quite intuitive
- In case of confusion, the input format looks like `1 1`, or `0 2`, you get the idea.
